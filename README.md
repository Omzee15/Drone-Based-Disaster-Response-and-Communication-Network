Problem Statement: Real-Time Disaster Information, Response & Crisis Management

PS-7_WEREWOLF_idea submission.p…
🌍 Project Overview
Your project proposes a Drone-Based Disaster Response and Communication Network designed to operate when traditional infrastructure collapses during natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and landslides.
Core Problem Identified
During disasters:
Roads get blocked
Mobile towers collapse
Power and communication fail
Rescue teams lack real-time visibility
This leads to:
Delayed rescue
Panic among victims
Poor coordination
High human risk
🚁 Proposed Solution
A Smart Drone-Based Aerial Communication & Assessment Network that provides:
✔ Immediate aerial surveillance
✔ Live damage assessment
✔ Emergency cellular connectivity
✔ Search & rescue support
✔ Medical and relief delivery
✔ Zone-wise disaster mapping
This creates a flying disaster-response infrastructure when ground infrastructure fails.

🟡 Phase 2 — Search & Connectivity Restoration (Core Innovation)
Two drone fleets operate in parallel:
🔍 Search Drones
Thermal & infrared sensors
Detect trapped survivors
Scan remote pockets
📡 Network Extension Drones (Key Innovation)
Act as mobile cell towers
Extend nearby networks or create satellite-backed networks
Enable:
Emergency calls
Victim-family communication
Coordination with rescue teams
This phase restores communication when towers are destroyed.
